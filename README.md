# 🤖 Applied AI Agents – Hands-on Systems I Built

This repository contains a collection of AI agents I designed and built
to solve real data science and analytics workflows.

The work emphasizes:
- Agentic reasoning
- Tool orchestration
- Rapid experimentation
- Production-minded design

Some agents were inspired by Google's Advent of Agents program,
but all implementations were extended, adapted, and refactored
to reflect my own design decisions.
