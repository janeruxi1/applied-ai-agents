# 🤖 Applied AI Agents – Hands-on Systems I Built

A collection of applied AI agents I built to support real-world
data science workflows such as exploration, experimentation,
and model monitoring.

This repo emphasizes:
- Agentic reasoning and tool orchestration
- Hypothesis-driven analysis
- Rapid experimentation with disciplined refactoring
- Production-minded design decisions

## Agents
- **EDA & Hypothesis Agent** – Automates exploratory analysis and hypothesis generation
- Experiment Review Agent (coming)
- Model Monitoring & Drift Agent (coming)

## Tech Stack
Python, LLM APIs, structured prompting, statistical tools

## Notes
Some ideas were inspired by public learning programs, but all agents
were implemented, extended, and documented based on my own design choices.
